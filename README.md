A .NET library that makes shelling out commands super easy and fluent.  Think of it as a way to build human-readable shell scripts with the power of a full programming language.

## Information

### Install

```bash
dotnet add package Sheller
```

### Test

Download the source and run.

```bash
dotnet test --filter os~nix
```

Or.

```bash
dotnet test --filter os~win
```

> NOTE: Windows tests require WSL.

### Compatibility

Latest .NET Standard 2.0.

### Examples

This library is extendable, but you can run it a few ways depending on how you have extended it.  For more examples, check out the [tests](src/Test/BasicTests.cs).

Just as one would expect from `IEnumerable`, and other fluent interface designs, the result of every call on `IShell` and `IExecutable` is a _new_ instance.  This means that you can reuse useful statements.

In addition, _future_ calls will not affect any previous instances, meaning you can safely chain them without affecting the calling instance.  A good example of this behavior is the fact that `myEnumerable.Where(...)` does not affect `myEnumerable`.

In general `With` methods can be called multiple times (multiple entries are allowed per execution context) and `Use` methods can only be called once (only one entry is allowed per execution context).  The context changes from `IShell` to `IExecutable` upon calling `IShell.UseExecutable`, so the methods available will be different once that method is called.

#### Basic

With no extensions, you would run a command like this.

```csharp
var echoResult = await Sheller.Builder
    .UseShell("/bin/bash")
        .WithEnvironmentVariable("MY_VAR", "lol")
    .UseExecutable("echo")
        .WithArgument("$MY_VAR")
    .ExecuteAsync();

var exitCode = result.ExitCode; // 0
var standardOutput = result.StandardOutput; // "lol\n"
var standardError = result.StandardError; // ""
var startTime = result.StartTime;
var endTime = result.EndTime;
var runTime = result.RunTime;
```

However, you can build your own custom `IShell` and `IExecutable` implementations that yield code that looks like this (Sheller ships with `Bash` and `Echo` by default).

```csharp
var result = await Sheller.Builder
    .UseShell<Bash>()
        .WithEnvironmentVariable("MY_VAR", varValue)
    .UseExecutable<Echo>()
        .WithArgument("$MY_VAR")
    .ExecuteAsync();

var echoValue = result; // "lol"
```

#### Reusable Objects

Just like one would expect from `IEnumerable`, and other fluent designs, the result of every call on `IShell` and `IExecutable` is a _new_ instance.  This means that you can reuse useful statements.

In addition, _future_ calls will not affect any previous instances, meaning you can safely chain them without affecting the calling instance.  A good example of this behavior is the fact that `myEnumerable.Where(...)` does not affect `myEnumerable`.

```csharp
var shell = Builder.UseShell<Bash>().WithEnvironmentVariable("MY_VAR", "cool");

var anotherShell1 = shell.WithEnvironmentVariable("MY_VAR_2", "beans");
var anotherShell2 = shell.WithEnvironmentVariable("MY_VAR_2", "stuff");

var echoResult1 = anotherShell1.UseExecutable<Echo>().WithArgument("$MY_VAR$MY_VAR_2").ExecuteAsync(); //result: "coolbeans".
var echoResult2 = anotherShell1.UseExecutable<Echo>().WithArgument("$MY_VAR$MY_VAR_2").ExecuteAsync(); //result: "coolstuff".

```

#### Environment Variables

You can set environment variables on the shell.

```csharp
var result = await Builder
    .UseShell<Bash>().WithEnvironmentVariable("MY_VAR", expected)
    .UseExecutable<Echo>().WithArgument("$MY_VAR")
    .ExecuteAsync();
```

#### Standard Output/Error

You can capture standard output and standard error.  These methods can be called multiple times.

```csharp
await Builder
    .UseShell<Bash>()
    .UseExecutable<Echo>()
        .WithArgument("saythings")
        .WithStandardOutputHandler(Console.WriteLine)
        .WithStandardErrorHandler()
    .ExecuteAsync();
```

#### Standard Input

You can pass standard input that gets captured during execution.  This method may be called multiple times.

```csharp
var echoResult = await Builder
    .UseShell<Bash>()
    .UseExecutable("read var1; read var2; echo $var1$var2")
        .WithStandardInput("cool")
        .WithStandardInput("library")
    .ExecuteAsync();

// echoResult is "coollibrary".
```

#### Input Request Handler

You can provide a handler that will be called when execution is blocked and waiting for input.  This can only be set once per execution context.

```csharp
var echoResult = await Builder
    .UseShell<Bash>()
    .UseExecutable($"read var1; echo $var1")
    .UseInputRequestHandler((stdout, stderr) =>
    {
        // Process stdout or stderr, if needed.
        // Process is blocked, waiting for this input.
        return Task.FromResult("awesome");
    })
    .ExecuteAsync();

// echoResult is "awesome".
```

#### No Throw

You can instruct the execution to _not_ throw on a non-zero exit code.  This method may only be called once.

```csharp
await Builder
    .UseShell<Bash>()
    .UseExecutable("foo")
    .UseNoThrow()
    .ExecuteAsync();
```

#### Result Selector

You can pass a map function to `ExecuteAsync` to "select" the result.

```csharp
var echoErrorCode = await Builder
    .UseShell<Bash>()
    .UseExecutable<Echo>().WithArgument("dummy")
    .ExecuteAsync(cr => 
    {
        return cr.ExitCode;
    });

// echoErrorCode is 0.
```

#### Execution Timeout

You can set the execution timeout.  This method can only be called once.

```csharp
await Builder
    .UseShell<Bash>()
    .UseExecutable<Sleep>()
        .WithArgument("10")
        .UseTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5))
    .ExecuteAsync();
```

#### Post Execution Wait

You can provide waiters that process the result and wait upon a task before completion of the outer task.  These waiters may be applied multiple times.  You can also set a wait timeout (only one) with `UseWaitTimeout`.

```csharp
var echoValue = await Builder
    .UseShell<Bash>()
    .UseExecutable<Echo>()
        .WithArgument("dummy")
        .WithWait(async cr => 
        {
            return SomethingThatIsATask();
        })
        .UseWaitTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30))
    .ExecuteAsync();
```

#### Reactive

You can subscribe to an internal `IObservable`.  You can call the subscriber multiple times.

```csharp
var events = new List<string>();

var command1 = Builder
    .UseShell<Bash>()
    .UseExecutable("echo")
    .WithArgument(expected)
    .WithSubscribe(o =>
    {
        o.Where(ev => ev.Type == CommandEventType.StandardOutput).Select(ev => ev.Data).Do(data =>
        {
            events.Add(data);
        }).Subscribe();
    })
    .ExecuteAsync();
```

#### Cancellation

You can set cancellation tokens.  This method may be called multiple times.

```csharp
using (var ctSource = new CancellationTokenSource())
{
    ctSource.CancelAfter(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));

    Builder
        .UseShell<Bash>()
        .UseExecutable<Sleep>()
        .WithArgument("10")
        .WithCancellationToken(ctSource.Token)
        .ExecuteAsync();
}
```

#### Character Encoding

You can set the output character encoding.  This method may only be called once.

```csharp
var echoValue = await Builder
    .UseShell<Bash>()
    .UseExecutable<Echo>()
        .WithArgument("ðŸ˜‹")
        .UseStandardOutputEncoding(Encoding.ASCII)
    .ExecuteAsync();

// echoValue is "????".
```

#### `StartInfo` Transform

You can arbitrarily change any options on the `StartInfo` of the process.  This method may only be called once.

```csharp
var echoValue = await Builder
    .UseShell<Bash>()
    .UseExecutable<Echo>()
        .WithArgument(expected)
        .UseStartInfoTransform(si => 
        {
            si.WorkingDirectory = "/";
        })
    .ExecuteAsync();
```

#### Roll Your Own

You can also roll your own `IShell` and `IExecutable` plugins.  For example, it would be nice to implement a `kubectl` wrapper.

```csharp
public interface IKubectl : IExecutable
{
    IKubectl WithKubeConfig(string configPath);
    IKubectl WithApply(string yamlPath);
}

public class Kubectl : Executable<IKubectl>, IKubectl
{
    // Allows the `Executable` base class to "create and clone" a new instance for chanining.
    protected override Executable<IKubectl> Create() => new Kubectl();
    // Sets the underlying executable of this executable type.
    public Kubectl() : base("kubectl") {}
    
    public IKubectl WithKubeConfig(string configPath) => this.WithArgument($"--kubeconfig={configPath}");
    public IKubectl WithApply(string yamlPath) => this.WithArgument("apply", "-f", yamlPath);
}

...

var result = await Builder
    .UseShell<Bash>()
    .UseExecutable<Kubectl>()
        .WithKubeConfig("kube_config.yaml")
        .WithApply("my_app.yaml")
    .ExecuteAsync();
```
